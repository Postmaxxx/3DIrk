working with webpack:
npm run buildw - build the project
npm run servew - run server for project
npm run predeploy - build the project to as preparation to deploy it to gh-pages
npm run deploy - deploy the project to gh pages, auto starts predeploy first (do not forget to check the folder to deploy, default - dist)

npm run deploy_old - deploy the project to gh pages using react builder, auto starts predeploy first (need to rename predeploy_old)
